# Installation

## Version Selection

In general, Inbucket pre-release (beta and release-candidate) versions are very
stable. If you can accept some risk, it is recommended to install a recent
pre-release over a very old stable release.

Release notes can be found on GitHub:
<https://github.com/inbucket/inbucket/releases>

The [Inbucket news page](https://inbucket.org/news/) often summarizes major
changes and risks for a particular release.
